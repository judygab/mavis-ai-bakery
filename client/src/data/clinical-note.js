Gen: slightly aggitated
HEENT: c-collar on, R forehead laceration, PERRL,EOMI
Chest: CTAB
CVS:RRR
Abd: soft, NT/ND
Ext: multiple ecchymosis, no edema,pulses +2 throughout
Neuro: alert,unable to follow commands, MAE


Pertinent Results:
[xxxx-xx-xx] CT HEAD WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: A focal area of increased
density is seen within the right temporoparietal sulci,
consistent with a focus of subarachnoid hemorrhage. No other
foci of subarachnoid hemorrhage are seen. No subdural or
intraparenchymal hemorrhages identified. The ventricles and
sulci are prominent, consistent with age-related atrophic
change. There is decreased attenuation in the periventricular
white matter, consistent with changes relating to chronic small
vessel ischemic infarct. There is extensive calcification of the
carotid arteries bilaterally. The basilar artery appears
tortuous. The soft tissue and osseous structures are within
normal limits.
IMPRESSION: Subarachnoid hemorrhage in the right temporoparietal
region.


Speech and Swallow eval [xxxx-xx-xx]
SUMMARY / IMPRESSION:
The pt did not appear aware of food in his mouth and is not
responding to feeding utensils or food in his mouth. He is not
safe to try to feed and PEG placement is recommended as an
alternate route for nutrition/hydration/medication.


RECOMMENDATIONS:
1.Pt should remain strictly NPO with PEG placement recommended
 for nutrition/hydration/meds


2.Pt should receive rigorous oral care

Brief Hospital Course:
Pt was a trauma transfer from an OSH where he was found to have
a Right tempoparietal SAH, on presentation he did not follow
commands but otherwise had a non-focal neuro exam. Neurology
and Neurosurgery were consulted regarding the patients MS change
and management of his SAH, respectively. Neurology suggested
and EEG which was read as inconsistent with seizure activity,
making this an unlikely contributor to his MS change.
Neurosurgery evaluated the SAH with serial head CTs which showed
stable SAH and used Dilantin for prophylaxis. After running
several test to further evaluate his dementia, the consensus
among teams was that his changes in mental status were due to
his SAH on top of his underlying dementia, the patient's mental
status failed to improve and a speech and swallow eval revealed
that he was unable to protect his airway with POs. The decision
was then made to insert a PEG and tube feeds were started. On
discharge the patient was afebrile, hemodynamically stable, and
alert, but was still unable to follow commands and was at best
oriented to self only.
