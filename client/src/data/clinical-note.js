Chief Complaint: Chest pain and shortness of breath

Major Surgical or Invasive Procedure: Coronary angiography with stent placement

History of Present Illness: Pt is a 68-year-old man with a PMH of hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hyperlipidemia who presented with acute onset chest pain and dyspnea.

The patient was in his usual state of health until three days prior to admission when he began experiencing intermittent chest discomfort. The pain was described as a heavy pressure located substernally, radiating to his left arm, and associated with shortness of breath and diaphoresis. Initially, symptoms occurred during exertion but progressed to occur at rest. He denied any relief with antacids or rest.

On the day of admission, the chest pain became more severe and unrelenting, lasting over 30 minutes, prompting his wife to call emergency services. Upon arrival to the ED, he continued to have chest pain rated 8/10 in intensity.

In the ED, initial VS showed BP 160/90 mmHg, HR 95 bpm, RR 20, T 98.6°F, O2 Sat 94% RA. An EKG revealed ST-segment elevations in leads II, III, and aVF consistent with an inferior MI. Initial troponin I levels were elevated.

He was given ASA 325 mg, SL nitroglycerin, and started on a heparin drip. He was emergently taken to the cardiac cath lab where a 95% occlusion of the RCA was found and successfully stented.

Post-procedure, Pt reported resolution of chest pain. He was monitored in the CCU and started on guideline-directed medical therapy including beta-blockers, ACE inhibitors, statins, and dual antiplatelet therapy.

He denies any recent travel, sick contacts, or exposure to COVID-19. He reports adherence to his medications but admits to dietary indiscretions and a sedentary lifestyle.
